# Deep Learning in R
This is the repository for D-Lab's R-Graphics workshop. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

**Prior experience with R is assumed such as R-Fundamentals Parts 1 through 4 or equivalent knowledge.
This is an advanced level workshop which requires participants to be intermediate R users and have had some prior exposure to machine learning.**

# Workshop Goals

Need to talk to team #1

# Installation Instructions

# Is R not running on your laptop?



# Run the code! 

Make instructions

# How to get help?

* Videos
    * J.J. Allaire [talk at RStudioConf 2018](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-and-r/)

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services. 

(include definition of IOKN2K!)
